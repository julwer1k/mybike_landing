# MyBike: A Landing Page for Bicycles

**MyBike** is a single-page web application designed to showcase bicycles and provide a visually appealing landing page for cycling enthusiasts. It leverages modern web development technologies to deliver a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience.


## Technologies Used

- SCSS: 
    - Mixins provide a way to define reusable code snippets for common styles, improving efficiency and consistency.
    - Variables allow for centralized control of design values, such as colors, fonts, and spacing, making style updates easier.
- BEM (Block-Element-Modifier)
